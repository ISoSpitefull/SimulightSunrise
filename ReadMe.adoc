= Simulight Sunrise

The Sunrise SimuLight is an alarm clock project designed to combat the challenges of waking up in regions where natural sunlight is scarce during early mornings, such as polar winters or densely overcast climates. By simulating the gradual, radiant glow of a sunrise, this device helps users start their day feeling refreshed and aligned with their body’s natural circadian rhythm, even though the real sun remains hidden for hours.

== Step 1: Setup
Please use either for uploading/maintaining code.
1. Arduino Cloud @ app.arduino.cc
2. Arduino IDE 2.x installed on your machine.

3. Setup connections on a breadboard or proto-board.
![schematic](https://github.com/ISoSpitefull/SimulightSunrise/blob/main/Schematic-SAC2025.png "Wiring Schematic")

4. Make connections as required and upload the code.
5. Input your SSID, "SECRET_DEVICE_KEY", and other setup in the "arduino_secrets.h" file.

== Step 2: Assemble the circuit

Assemble the circuit following the diagram "Schematic-SAC2025.png" attached to the repository.

== Step 3: Upload Code and WiFi Setting

Upload the code contained in this sketch on to your board with your wifi settings in the correct fields.
